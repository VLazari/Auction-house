Auction-house is a web application that allows users to participate in auctions for various items. Users can create listings, place bids, and manage their credits on the platform.

## Description

The Auction-house project is a web application designed to provide an auction platform for users. It allows registered users to create listings for items, specify a deadline for bidding, and provide descriptions and media galleries for each listing. Other registered users can place bids on the listings using their available credits. The application also supports features like user registration, login, and the ability to update avatars.

This project focuses on the frontend implementation of the Auction-house application. The API functionality is managed by an existing application, and this project interacts with that API to provide the user interface and functionality.
